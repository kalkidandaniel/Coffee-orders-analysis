### * Project Background
This project explores transactional data from a coffee retailer to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and the impact of loyalty programs on revenue. By leveraging Excel for analysis and dashboard creation, the project aims to deliver actionable insights that can support marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and customer segmentation strategies. Key performance indicators such as sales volume, roast popularity, and loyalty card usage were analyzed across different dimensions including product size, country, and customer behavior.

### * Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
This analysis investigates customer purchasing behavior using coffee order data. Sales trends revealed that medium-sized coffees were the most ordered, followed by strong preferences for Espresso and Latte types. Customers using loyalty cards showed higher average spending and more frequent large-sized orders. Dark roast varieties, in particular, contributed significantly to per-unit revenue. Insights derived from the dashboard provide clear evidence of the value of loyalty incentives and product-size optimization in increasing overall revenue and customer retention.

### * Recommendations
#### - Enhance Loyalty Program Outreach
Customers with loyalty cards not only spent more on average but also placed larger orders. Promoting loyalty program benefits more aggressively—through personalized emails, in-store signage, or referral incentives—can boost enrollment and long-term customer value.

#### - Prioritize Medium-Sized Product Inventory
Medium cups were the most commonly ordered size, suggesting strong customer preference. Ensuring adequate inventory of medium-sized cups and related packaging can prevent missed sales due to stockouts and meet demand more efficiently.

#### - Promote Dark Roast Offerings
Dark roast coffee types generated the highest sales per unit, making them strong candidates for upselling. Consider bundling dark roast varieties with complementary items or featuring them in seasonal campaigns to maximize profit margins.

#### - Segment Campaigns by Region and Loyalty
Urban-based and loyal customers showed distinct purchasing behaviors. Creating region-specific and loyalty-based marketing campaigns—such as exclusive loyalty offers in urban areas—can drive targeted engagement and increase ROI on promotional efforts.
